In general: For every function we get the plain text from the TextInput macro. So if we want
to change the plaintext we change that. SIZE_OF_TEXT is the length of TextInput.

We generate the random key with the getRandomkey() function in the main function
and then we pass the string as argument to the functions. We need to print the cipher
in hex format in order not to lose any characters.

Spartan encrypt: 

The len argument specifies the length of the plain text.
